# Overview 

This is a pretty little android application written in Kotlin which will help you make a nice shopping list. You can add items, mark them as bought/not bought, delete them one by one, or delete them all at once. 

# Installation

If you wish to compile and run the application, just import the whole project in Android Studio and build it.
Alternatively, you can download and install "app-debug.apk" on your android device.

# Features
The application implements:
- Multiple Activities (Splash Screen, Main, New Item)
- Lists (RecyclerView)
- Persistent data storage (Room)
- Network communication (Retrofit for Currency Rates)

# UI Elements
The Shopping List can display:
- icon for the item (an ImageView based on the Category),
- checkbox whether it has been bought or not (user can change it during shopping),
- name of the item
- additional attributes can also be displayed of course!

_All the image/icon assets are included in the <a href="https://github.com/SABERGLOW/SparMePlease/Assets"> Assets </a> folder_
